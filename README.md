# Finchart
Advanced financial charting JavaScript library developed by **Bahtera Capital**.
This charting library is designed with finance and statistics in mind, so popular chart type such as candlestick is supported out of the box.
Feel free to use it (attribution is highly encouraged). If you find bugs or have a nice idea, please submit an issue to this repository.

## Usage
Download `finchart.js` from `dist` folder and include this line just before your page closing `</body>` tag:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/finchart.js"></script>
```
